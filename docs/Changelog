26/1/2011 updated the logging configurations, so that we log on INFO in
individuals files, and WARN in the doms.log file.

26/1/2011 Updated base objects so that
 1. removed the big pbcore placeholder from template_program, as it was clogging up the summa

 referring to the default open License. This speeds up ingests x2.
